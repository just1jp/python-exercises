#A Few Common Python Coding Challenges

This repo contains solutions to four python coding problems including:

### 1. Largest Palindrome

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. For example, 1234321 is a palindrome. The largest palindrome made from the product of two two-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 × 99. Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two three-digit numbers. Afterward, write a brief explanation walking through your code's logic in markdown.

### 2. Summation of Primes

The sum of the primes below 10 is 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 17. Find the sum of all the primes below 2,000. Afterward, write a brief explanation walking through your code's logic in markdown.

### 3. Multiples of 3 and 5

If we list all of the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6, and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 and 5 below 1,000. Afterward, write a brief explanation walking through your code's logic in markdown.

### 4. String Compressor

Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. (This is called run-length encoding.) For example, the string "aabcccccaaa" would become a2b1c5a3. If the “compressed” string would not become smaller than the original string, your method should return the original string. You can assume the string has only uppercase and lowercase letters (a–z). Specify whether your solution is case sensitive or case insensitive and what you would need to change to make it the other. Afterward, write a brief explanation walking through your code's logic in markdown.
